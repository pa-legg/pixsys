# PixSys
Pixel-based Visualisation of Systems and Networks

The PixSys tool was developed as part of our research on malware dynamic behaviour and propagation analysis. The accompanying paper is "Investigating malware propagation and behaviour using system and network pixel-based visualisation" (link to come soon).

Usage:
Open <b>202107-malvis.ipynb</b> in the Jupyter Lab environment. This calls the extractcsv Python script that converts monitor tool output to CSV data files, and then can be used to create pixel-based visualisation output to convery CPU, RAM, screen, network, and process machine usage patterns.

- Virtual Machine Monitor (Client/Server) to be uploaded
- Example Data Output for generating plots to be uploaded
- Example Virtual Machine for conducting experiment to be uploaded
